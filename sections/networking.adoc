== Distributed computing

[quote, Microsoft mailing list 1987, Leslie Lamport]
A distributed system is one in which the failure of a computer you didn’t even know existed can render your own computer unusable.

. The network is reliable.
. Latency is zero.
. Bandwidth is infinite.
. The network is secure.
. Topology doesn't change.
. There is one administrator.
. Transport cost is zero.

== CAP + Network Fallacies

Client-Side Service Discovery / Load balancing::
Service registers itself in a central repository. The repository also provides an information about other services availability. 
Other services request the information and autonomously decide which instances are called.

Server-Side Service Discovery / Load balancing::
Service registers itself in a central repository. 
Other services access the repository (single address), which internally forwards the request to an available instance.

== Brewer's theorem (CAP theorem)

[quote, 1998]
(...) it is impossible for a distributed computer system to simultaneously provide all three of the following guarantees: Consistency, Availability and Partition tolerance.

[%notitle]
== CAP guarantees

*Consistency*::
Every read receives the most recent write or an error

*Availability*::
Every request receives a (non-error) response – without the guarantee that it contains the most recent write

*Partition tolerance*::
The system continues to operate despite an arbitrary number of messages being dropped (or delayed) by the network between nodes

[.statement]
in the absence of partitions, one has to choose between *latency* and *consistency*

It's still distributed system, still latency is non zero

== PACELC theorem

[quote, Daniel J. Abadi 2012]
Ignoring the consistency/latency tradeoff of replicated systems is a major oversight [in CAP], as it is present at all times during system operation, whereas CAP is only relevant in the arguably rare case of a network partition.
